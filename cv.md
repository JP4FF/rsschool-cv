### [**Biographical Statement:**](#biographical-statement)

I am 25 years old and I work as an engineer at the State Institution "Belarusian Research Centre for Pediatric Oncology, Hematology and  
Immunology". My direct responsibilities include the design and creation of various functional software for recording the medical patient  
indicators, the creation and maintenance of medical registries (databases), support and maintenance of the republican registry of  
[Primary Immunodeficiencies](http://178.124.197.87/imreg/). At this moment I am engaged in the design and creation of a new version of this registry.

I gained knowledge in programming languages such as Delphi and C ++, learned how to use the framework for creating web applications in  
Delphi ([UniGui](http://www.unigui.com/)), and also know how to work with the MS SQL Server database management system and have knowledge of the T-SQL language.

During my work, I have shown myself as a reliable and hardworking employee, I work well in a team, I can and want to learn and develop  
new skills. If I start to do something, I always try to do it to the highest standard of quality, so that I would not be ashamed of my work.

Unfortunately, my current job has no career opportunities and sooner or later will lead me to stagnation. That is why I decided to study  
web technologies, because this direction provides unlimited opportunities for creativity and career growth. I believe that my ability to learn  
and acquire new skills will help me walk this path and become a good Frontend developer.

### [**Code example:**](#code-examples)

The task: Your job is to figure out the index of which vowel is missing from a given string:

- A has an index of 0,
- E has an index of 1,
- I has an index of 2,
- O has an index of 3,
- U has an index of 4.

Notes: There is no need for string validation and every sentence given will contain all vowles but one. Also, you won't need to worry about capitals.

```js
function absentVowel(x) {
  if (!x.includes("a")) {
    return 0;
  }
  if (!x.includes("e")) {
    return 1;
  }
  if (!x.includes("i")) {
    return 2;
  }
  if (!x.includes("o")) {
    return 3;
  }
  if (!x.includes("u")) {
    return 4;
  }
}
```
